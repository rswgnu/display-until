;;; Commentary:

;; (RSW would like this code to be added to core Emacs if it is
;;  acceptable.  Someone else who adds to Emacs regularly would have
;;  to add the NEWS entry, Elisp Manual entry and commit the code.
;;  In that case, the utilty macros and function names could be generalized).

;; This library temporarily displays an existing or new frame topmost in
;; the frame stack.  Then it restores the prior topmost frame as well
;; as any prior visibility status of the temporarily displayed frame,
;; e.g. if it was hidden or iconified.  See the end of the file for
;; sample usage expressions.

;; This library includes the following:
;;   Variable:
;;     display-until-delay - time in seconds to display a temporary frame or
;;       window
;;
;;   Display Functions:
;;     display-window-until - given a window and optional buffer, display the
;;       buffer in the window, make the window's frame topmost for
;;       `display-until-delay' seconds, then return the window's frame
;;       to its prior visibility
;;
;;     display-frame-until - given a frame and optional buffer, display the
;;       buffer in the frame's selected window, make the frame topmost for
;;       `display-until-delay' seconds, then return the frame to its prior
;;       visibility
;;
;;   Utility Functions:
;;     display-until-get-frame-by-name - given a name string, return the
;;       matching frame or nil
;;
;;   Utility Macros:
;;     display-until-condition-or-timeout - wait for a boolean condition
;;       or timeout seconds
;;     display-until-thread-condition-or-timeout - run a thread until a boolean
;;;      condition or timeout seconds
